# Pwn

To dominate in such a fashion as to gain ownership. A network, system, organization, or rival that comes under an adversary's control is said to have been pwned.

If you are not familiar with Assembly take a look at my [asm cheat sheat](https://github.com/Gottiee/asm)

## Usefull Cmd

Cmd | explanation
--- | ---
```ldd <binary file>``` | check which library is used
```cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space``` | '0' no aslr / '1' aslr for lib / '2' aslr for lib and exe
```cat <(python /tmp/exec.py) -| ./exploit.me``` | interactive exploit with cat command bloque

## Usefull Help

Reminder: In the C calling conversion up to six arguments will be placed to the RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8 and R9 registers and anything additional will be placed in to the stack.
