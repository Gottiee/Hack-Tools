# Dirb

## List directory and files

##### Explanation

Dirb is a command-line tool used for directory and file enumeration on web servers. It operates by sending HTTP requests to a target server and analyzing the responses to identify directories and files that are publicly accessible.

By analyzing server responses and HTTP status codes, Dirb helps security professionals and penetration testers discover hidden or unlinked resources on a web server.

#### Usage

```bash
$> dirb dirb https://192.168.1.120:443
```
